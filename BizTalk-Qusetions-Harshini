# BizTalk Topics

1. BizTalk Server Architecture
2. Components of BizTalk Server :
3. Types of Subscriptions in BizTalk (Activation & Instance)
    1. Activation : when ever a new message is received, this will activate or create a new instance of the subscriber.
    2. Instance : Message should be routed to an already running instance of the subscriber. Request-Response / correalted receives.
4. Persistence points & Examples of Persistence points
    1. To allow rehydration of orchestration instance, the orchestration engine saves the entire state of an orchestration instance at various points.
5. Distinguished Fields
    1. Can only accessible with in the orchestration.
6. Promoted Properties
    1. Can be accessible in all phases like receive port, orch and send ports.
7. Context Based Routing
    1. Routing based on the default properties of BizTalk. BTS.ReceivePortName or BTS.MessageType
8. Content Based Routing
    1. Routing based on the message. Create a schema, Promote any element (ex. Bank name) in sp : filter condition (applicationName.schemaName.BankName == SBI) --> this will deliver only sbi bank details to this send port.
9. How to transfer Files without using orchestrations
10. Parallel Convoy
    1. Must know about correlation type and correlation set before doing this.
    2. Mulitple single messages to join together to achieve a required result.
    3. The set of messages can arrive in any order but BizTalk server must receive them before start of the process.
11. Sequential convoy
    1. Multiple single mesaages to join together to archive a required result. But BizTalk server must receive them in sequential order.
12. Correlation in BizTalk ( Correlation Type & Correlation Set)
    1. Associating incoming message with the appropriate instance of an orchestration
    2. For implementing corelations, both input and output messages should have a common filed element and also the common element should be promoted properly.
13. BizTalk Databases
    1. Management db - host, host instances
    2. Rules Engine db
    3. Tracking db - contains message bodies and promoted properties
    4. Message box db
14. BizTalk SQL Jobs ( any 5 )
15. BizTalk server Rules Engine
16. "Message Type" in BizTalk server
    1. Each message must be of a selected message type.
    2. Common message type is Schema.
17. How and where "messages" are created in an Orchestration (within Maps in Transform Shape)
18. Dehydration & Rehydration
    1. When an Orchestration has been idle for a while, the Orchestration engine will save the state information of the instance and free up memory resources.
    2. Rehydration : the orchestration engine loads the saved instance of the orchestration into memory, restores the state and runs it from thr point where it left.
19. Pipeline Stages
    1. Receive side :
        1. Decode
        2. Disassemble
        3. Validate
        4. Resolve Party
    2. Send side :
        1. Pre assemble
        2. Assemble
        3. Encode
20. Custom Pipeline stages
    1. IBase Component
    2. IComponentUI
    3. IComponent
    4. IPersistPropertyBag
    5. IAssembleComponent
    6. IDisassembleComponent
    7. IProbeMessage
21. Host & Host Instances
22. Different types of Schemas and steps to create( document & flat file schemas are important)
23. Difference between Call Orchestration and Start Orchestration
24. Different Shapes in Orchestration ( Message Assignment shape, Expression shape, Listen shape, Delay shape)
25. Different Adapters in BizTalk (http, https, WCF, SQL, File adapters are important)
26. Functiods in BizTalk (Value mapping functoids is important ; String, Mathematical, Logic and Scripting functoids)
27. How to write Xpath expression : Xpath allows you to navigate through the xml document and select a particular value.
28. Types of Bindings in BizTalk
    1. Receive port side : Specify now, Specify later, Direct Bindings)
    2. Send Port Side : Specify now, Specify later, Direct Binding, Dynamic Binding)
29. Direct binding
    1. Direct binding is used to send messages form one orchestration to another orchestration.
    2. Orch 1 : The process will send mesaage to second orchestration
    3. Orch 2 : This will receive message from first orchestration
    4. In second send port : set properties as PortBindings : "Direct" and select "To receive message from other orchestration" and select second orchestration name in Orchestration 1.
30. Difference between BizTalk server and Webservices
31. How can we prevent orchestration from entering into suspended state (Applying error handling )
    1. Error handling in Biztalk orchestration is handled using scope shape
32. BizTalk Orchestration is both Subscrber and Publisher.
33. BizTalk Server architecture is asynchronous : messages flow one way into BizTalk server.
34. Types of schemas : document schema, property schema, flat file schema
35. Singleton types never have more than one instance at any one time.
